      <h2>5 SIMPLE STEPS TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Ken Davadilla, Aug 25, 2016.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-danger">Goals</span> <span class="label label-primary"> LifeStrategy</span></h5><br>

      <div class="well">
      <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-success-img.jpg">
      <p>“How can I possibly achieve my goals when there’s just so many??”  There’s financial goals, personal development goals, family, health, etc..etc..etc. They seem to pile up and when we seem to be catching up, we hit a roadblock which diverts our attention to something else, leaving us to start all over again. It’s a vicious cycle that leads to unhappiness and poor self-image.<p>

      <p>Sure, it’s a good thing to have life goals. It’s better to aim than miss than never aim at all. Ever tried hitting a target that’s not there? How do we actually achieve our goals the right way?</p>
      </div>
<strong>1. Be Specific with your goals</strong>

<p>You can’t say you want to have “plenty of money” as your financial goal.. Only 5-year olds would say such things. Set a specific amount that you want to earn like 1 million before retirement, It really depends on your dreams. Decide how much comfort you want to have for your future and equate that with an amount you want to earn. If you want to lose weight then create a detailed plan saying how much weight in pounds/kilos.</p>

<strong>2. Start with Goals for yourself</strong>

<p>You need to build momentum and the best way to do so is by accomplishing goals for yourself 1st. In our impossible pursuit to please everyone around us, we start by crossing out items and tasks that benefits others more than ourselves and in return leaving less time for us to get our own goals down. You are the most important person in the process of realizing your dreams. It’s a given – you cannot start giving others what you yourself don’t have. Start with YOU first!<p>

<strong>3. Break them down into pieces</strong> 

<p>This requires you to sit down and with a pen and paper, write down the steps to achieve your goals. Sometimes, it can be overwhelming to take on projects when we think too much about how much time and energy we need to spend on it entirely. Although if we sort it into bite size pieces, it wouldn’t be daunting at all. Say you need to write a book and you begin with the 1st five chapters and you do this <em>DAILY</em>. Without you noticing it, you finished the book! Compared to you forcing yourself to finish it in less time but losing all your hair at the same time..</p>

<strong>4. Set A Deadline</strong>

<p>“Without a sense of urgency, desire loses it’s value” by Jim Rohn. Simply put, your goals should be time bounded. Zig Ziglar always ask his audience, “why do we get more work done on the day before we go on a vacation?”. Simply because our mindset says all must be delivered by the end of the day so we can enjoy and relax knowing all is taken care of. Now why can’t we do the same daily? If you plan to lose weight, do it within the next 100 days. If you want to continue your studies, do it before the year ends.</p>

<strong>5. Work on your goals Efficiently and Consistently</strong>

<p>Get up early in the morning and avoid staying late at night so you will have enough energy since we are most productive during daytime. As much as possible, avoid multi-tasking. We often hear that multi-tasking is a critical skill needed in most jobs. Though correct, it does have an adverse effect in your efficiency and work quality. Try focusing all your energy and time in one task before moving to another so your flow of work is consistent and you have accurate results to produce. Make good use of your time meaning minimize unnecessary tasks in your list that do not anyway contribute to your goals. Also, there might be things that you can scrap from your schedule in order to make time spent thus improving your overall efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Success and Work – Life Balance</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Bianca Dolor, Sep 10, 2017.</h5>
      <h5><span class="label label-success">Life</span></h5>

      <div class="well">
      <img class="img-responsive" src="img/blog-worklife-img.jpg">
      <p>Alain de Botton once said, “There is no such thing as work-life balance. Everything worth fighting for unbalances your life.” People argue about the existence of work life balance because they they’ve tried and still try to apply based on personal definitions and priorities, miss the entire point and result to futile outcomes.
      </div>

<p>There are <strong>7 spokes</strong> in life: <em>career, financial, spiritual, physical, intellectual, family, and social</em>. Work, if you think about it, is heavily connected to most of these. Career for most people, is life itself, but it doesn’t have to be employment or business – related.</p>

<p>People fail to acknowledge that others have careers that don’t involve pay (money), like mothers who dedicate their lives to bettering the lives of her children, or volunteers who devote their lifetime appearing in outreach programs to help the unfortunate. Career to me is what you do with the majority of your time without sacrificing self – fulfillment.</p>

<p><blockquote>It’s what you wouldn’t mind being defined with for the rest of your life. Simply, it’s what you do. The financial spoke is more of a state of mind. My definition of rich may not be your definition of rich. It is the level of your security knowing you’ll have enough to spend on the things that matter that defines your financial health.</blockquote></p> 
<p>The question most of the time is, what does matter to oneself? Spiritual, regardless of religion, is how strong your belief system is and how connected you are to your God. Spiritual health is measured by your ability to apply the teachings and practices of your belief in your daily life. Meanwhile, the physical spoke is measured by the existing standards for our physiological health.</p>

<p>People commonly misunderstand this spoke as just exercise, but it’s just not that. With more communicable diseases being spread, and industrialization making organic food less available, we make ourselves prone to illnesses that would potentially shorten our life expectancies. To me, physical health is being able to extend your life span more than you’d expected it to last, doing all things possible to contribute to that goal.</p> 

<p>Intellectual is our mental health, our ability to comprehend and imagine, our capacity for understanding things that are not easily understandable for everyone less.  Family is easy. It’s who you run off to when everything else fails. It’s most people’s best support system. Lastly, social, which is our bigger network outside the family, is composed of friends, schoolmates, workmates, neighbors, workmates, etc. It’s measured by our connectivity and impact to the lives of the people around us, much like family.</p>
 
<p>Now, let’s focus on work and how it’s connected to life and its seven spokes. Are those two mutually exclusive? Looking at the examples previously mentioned, it’s easy to surmise that there is interconnectivity with work and life, and it’s almost impossible to work on any spoke of life without affecting work itself. In fact, in most situations, it’s absolutely necessary to develop oneself in 2-3 of these spokes in order to make headway on what we do for a living. <p>

<p>For example, we can’t be at our best when we’re sick, can’t be promoted if not collaborative, can’t pitch in ideas if we’re not imaginative, and can’t correct our mistakes without feedback from peers. Also, some people are taught to surrender, offer, or dedicate their work to their God, as a sign of worship, and commitment to apply spiritual teachings at work. And lastly, and more obviously, most people work to satisfy their financial spoke in life. Regardless of which spoke is more important to anyone, if one would work on any of these, there will certainly be impact to work, either directly, or indirectly.</p>
 
<p>Success doesn’t have to come at the expense of life itself. Success to me, is being able to work on as much as the spokes of life as you can, getting the best possible outcome for all. The goal at the end of the line is to balance everything. </p>
<p>At some point in the race, we may be more focused on one thing, or another, but without consciously knowing it, we in fact work on not just our careers but everything else. We shouldn’t look at work as just means to satisfy our financial needs. We have other needs too. We will never feel truly happy and satisfied with work if we are not happy and satisfied with life</p>
